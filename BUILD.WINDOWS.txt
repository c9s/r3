Building with CMAKE on Windows using VCPKG
=======================================

   This document describes how to compile, build and install libr3 on Windows using CMake, MSVC compiler and VCPKG

   VCPKG can be installed from
   
     https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg

   Once VCPKG is installed you must install libcheck and pcre before running the folloiwing command to configure build

    cmake -H"." -B"<BUILD_DIRECTORY>" -G"<GENERATOR_NAME>" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_FILE> -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=<VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET>

   Then to perform build

    cmake --build -B"<BUILD_DIRECTORY>" --target ALL_BUILD --config "<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>"

   Then to run tests, you must copy pcre.dll and pcre.pdb file to output directory prior to running tests

    cmake --build -B"<BUILD_DIRECTORY>" --target RUN_TESTS --config "<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>"

   Window build is currently WIP.
